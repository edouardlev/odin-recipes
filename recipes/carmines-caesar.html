    <h3>Carmine's buttery caesar salad recipe will bring you right back to times square</h3>
    <h4>Back in January I bookmarked a recipe for Caesar salad dressing on the blog, Little Brown Pen. The description of the flavor sounded great, and the provenance 
        of the recipe (Carmine's) was trustworthy. One of the reasons that a Caesar dressing caught my eye is because one of our favorite local restaurants, Dino, 
        serves an excellent Caesar salad, which they make with a combo of romaine lettuce and raw lacinato kale. It's a simple, but surprising twist on a classic. The 
        kale adds some complexity (and nutrients!) to your average Caesar, and it's a good strong leaf to hold up to a thick, garlic-y dressing like this</h4>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>6 Anchovy Fillets</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic, Peeled</li>
        <li>2 Large Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 small lemon</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons grated romano</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, puree the 6 anchovy fillets. </li>
         <li>  Add the garlic and blend the mixture until it is well mixed.</li>
         <li> Add the egg yolks and blend the mixture for about 2 minutes.</li>
         <li>Turn off the motor, add the vinegar and lemon juice, and pulse the mixture for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>With the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream until it is incorporated. </li>
        <li>Add the cheese, parsley, and oregano and pulse the mixture for 10 seconds.</li>
         <li>Season the dressing to taste with salt and pepper. </li> 
         <li>Transfer it to a glass or rigid plastic container, cover it tightly, 
            and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Chilling
             the dressing thickens it and the thicker it gets, the better it will adhere to the lettuce.</li>
     </ol>
